## Developments

I remember looking at TRO 002/2020 and there was a clause that sites should be protected with a special "CBGA" encryption algorithm. Despite the fact that I know nothing about cryptography, I will still try to recreate this algorithm, since it is useless to look for its sources. [This directory](https://github.com/Joomipoll/volant-docs/tree/CBGA/CBGA), I will try to write the code and put it in the public domain
